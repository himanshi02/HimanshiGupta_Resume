\section*{Projects}


\begin{tabular}{r|p{12cm}} %enumerated
 \textsc{Jan-Feb 2018} & \emph{Autonomous Line Following Bot}\\&{The bot was devised to traverse the arena along the lines of black coloured grid and reach the destination in the minimum possible time. A line following bot which mainly incorporated the use of Arduino Uno, IR Sensor array, L293D motor driver. }\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 \textsc{Sep-Nov 2018} & \emph{Wireless Game Controller using Infrared Data Transmission}\\&{A wireless gesture recognition setup which is used in place of keyboard to play various games like Asphalt, Star Defender. These are played using hand gestures, transmitted to the system as virtual keyboard press using a python interface. The gesture recognition is done by an IR Transmitter and Receiver system. The hardware setup involved the usage of Arduino Uno, Nano, accelerometer ADXL335,TSOP 1738. }\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
\textsc{Ongoing} & \emph{Ant Bot}\\&{Inspired from the real life working of ants, this project delves into colour image processing, path planning algorithms, pick and place mechanisms and line following using phototransistor sensor. The tasks done by the bot include collecting, supplying and removing inventories on the arena in the minimum possible time.  }\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
\textsc{Ongoing} & \emph{Y Charger}\\&{A research project based to implement a wireless charging system using magnetic coupled resonant circuits }\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
\textsc{Ongoing} & \emph{Smart Adaptive Traffic Control System}\\&{A real life based Traffic System Model which incorporates the usage of Smart Switching algorithms and wireless V2I communication using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and detectors. More than a tangible project, this project is an idea, which in real time would reduce the fuel wastage due to idealing of vehicles at the traffic light junctions and give prioritized authorization to Emergency Service Vehicles.}
